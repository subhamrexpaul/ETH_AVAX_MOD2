# Fusion of Smart Contracts and Frontend Interface

## Overview

Presenting the Subham FoodPoint application - a dynamic platform facilitating user interaction with an Ethereum smart contract. This novel application empowers users to seamlessly manage their accounts, maintain balances, and execute a diverse array of transactions through the utilization of bespoke tokens.

## Quick Start Guide

To swiftly embark on this coding journey, follow these steps to breathe life into the code on your local machine.

1. Within the project directory, type the following command in your terminal: `npm install`
2. Unfold the canvas of your Visual Studio Code with two additional terminals.
3. Within the second terminal, usher in the Ethereum node with this directive: `npx hardhat node`
4. Within the third terminal, unveil the deployment script using the command: `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`
5. Return to the first terminal and orchestrate the symphony with the command: `npm run dev`, thus launching the frontend.

With these actions, the project will spring to life on your very own localhost, predominantly accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`

Diving into the Frontend Realm: Behold "Drinkshub," a realm of interaction with an array of intricate components. Here, the curtain rises on the stage of financial prowess as you deftly deposit and withdraw Ethereum from your Metamask wallet. The ability to perform token burns is also at your fingertips.

### Enabling Deposits
Initiate the ethereal art of depositing Ethereum from your Metamask wallet to the designated platform.

### Executing Withdrawals
Mastery over the cosmos of finance unveils itself as you withdraw Ethereum from your Metamask wallet.

### Mastering HandleBurn
Empower yourself by obliterating tokens within the expanse of the Metamask wallet, embracing the force of metamorphosis.

Embrace this technological symposium where smart contracts and frontend artistry converge harmoniously to sculpt the future of decentralized interaction.
